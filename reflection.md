- Which methods did you decide to `overload`, and why?

CAFE: I overloaded the cafe and sellcoffee methods. These seem like the simplest methods to overload. For the cafe method I changed the amount of starting cups I had and for the sell coffee method I chose to decrease the amount of coffee cups rather than each ingredient in a cup of coffee. 

HOUSE: I overloaded the movein and moveout methods. What I implemented basically counteracts the purpose of the original method. So for moveout, I changed the method to accomodate for the scenerio in which the resident decides to stay and vice versa or the movein method. If I'm being completely honest I do not think the logic of my new overloaded methods for this childclass is completely solid However, I believe with some more time and staring at it I could make it work by making a few changes. 

LIBRARY: I overloaded the addtitle and removetitle methods. For this overload method I am able to clear out the entire library for the scenerio in which the libary is being permantely closed. I used it for both the addtitle and removetitle methods because this type of event can happen at anytime in the real world. 

I would say for the most part each step of the assignment seemed easy to do. I feel like the only thing I am currently struggling with is understanding what my code is meant to do. I know we were tasked with creating buildings and setting their corresponding functions all while inheritating certain aspects from the building parent class, however I was unsure how to get each child class to run because I don't understand what output I was supposed to get out of each class. I think being given examples of what we should be seeing in the terminal for future assignments would be helpful. I am turning in my assignment to get a grade but I do plan on redoing a lot of it after we get our feedback becasue I believe my confusion led to some parts of my program not fufilling the reqs of this assignment. 

I havent had the time to go to TA hours but I highly reccomend doing so for future students.
